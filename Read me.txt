# Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Bootstrapped Dual Policy Iteration

This repository contains the complete implementation of the Bootstrapped Dual Policy Iteration algorithm we developed over the past year and a half. The repository also contains scripts to re-run and re-plot our experiments.

## Organization

The following components are available in this repository

* The complete Python 3 source code of our algorithm;
* TSUP OpenAI Gym environments;

The files are organized as follows:

gym_envs: Gym environments.
	type of TUSP problem can be changed in: gym_envs/TUSP.py in function reset. which data to load for the game in: gym_envs/TUSP.py under __init__
main.py: A simple RL agent that performs actions in a Gym environment, and learns using BDPI. training hyperparameters can be changed here.
bdpi.py: The BDPI learning algorithm (actor, critics, and glue between them)

monitor_training.ipynb: Look at rewards, length, probabilities, and average q_values evolve in training
